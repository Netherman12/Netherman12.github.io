    <h2 id="usage-of-links">How links are used</h2>
    <p>Links are used to get from one page to another.<br>
       
           Links are really useful when you have to get pages that you usually type a lot. <br> 
           It can be a pain for the user just making them type. <br>          That's why we should add links and internal links to our webpages. 
           
       </p>
    <h2>How links are made</h2>
    <p id="links-are-made">
        Links are (obviously) made in HTML. <br> 
        When we add a link to our webpage it allows the user to do so much, they can go to different pages, do stuff on those pages, and with internal links they can go to different parts of your webpage!
        
        
    </p>
        
        <h2 id="figuring-out-links">Figuring out more about links</h2>   
        <p>
        
            If we want to learn more about links we can search on several other different sites <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">Here's a link to Wikipedia article about links</a>.<br> 
            You can check out some other different sites that talk about links(and be sure go on to some random site that has a link in it and press on "view source").<br>

  <h2>Where you can learn more</h2>
    <p id="learning-more-about-links">
    There is so much you can do with links so why don't you try it out yourself? <br> <a href="https://wikihow.com/Create-a-Link">Here's a link to an area where you can learn to make links.</a> Thanks for reading my webpage!<br> (P.S.
